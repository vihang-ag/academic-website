I want machines that can collaborate with us, augmenting our capabilities and enabling us to attain superhuman performances. Fascinated, I am developing algorithms that use the power of deep learning and ideas from computer vision and Human-AI interaction to build intelligent agents. My goal is to be at the forefront of research in this direction and develop AI driven products at scale. I recently got my masters from University of Michigan, where I was fortunate enough to work with Prof. David Fouhey on problems in Robot Navigation/3D visual scene understanding and with Prof. James Balter in Deep Learning for Medical Imaging. I also have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, India along with a minor in Artificial Intelligence.
